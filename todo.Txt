## FIX PASTE LAYERS. QFN PADS ARE TO BIG FOR INSTANCE. DOUBLE CHECK OTHER STUFF
2019-02-25

## Check placement and spacing for vias

## CHECK PCB layout OF 1V1 REGULATOR

## CHECK PCB layout OF POWER ENALERS FOR USB POWER DOWNSTREAM3

## IN SCHEMATIC:
- MAKE CLEAR WHICH CAP IS FOR WHAT POWERPIN

## CHECK FOOTPRINTS SO NO MULTIPLE FOOTPRINTS FOR THE SAME COMPONENT VALUE

## ADD PROPER COMPONENT PART NUMBERS ETC

## MOVE SS TRACE AT BOTTOM OF PCB AF LONG IN FROM EDGE AS POSSIBLE

## PLACE GROUNDING VIAS (WHEN LENGTH MATCHING IS DONE)

## CHECK DISTANCE BETWEEN SIGNAL TRACE AND GND PLANE ON SAME LAYER (TOP)

## ADJUST WIDTH OF TRACES TO ACCOMODATE THE DESIGNED FOR CURRENT (currently some are overkill)
1A: 0.3mm?
3A?

## CHECK THAT ALTIUM RULES AND FAB RULES ALIGN

## FIX FILLS UNDER USB A CONNECTORS
- ## CHECK IF FILLS UNDER CONNECTOR IS CORRECT, CHECK TI REF DESIGNS. SHOULD BE POURS INSTEAD?

## NO/MINIMAL THERMAL RELIEF ON SOME COMPONENTS CONNECTED TO HIGH CURRENT AND FILLS, WILL BE A PAIN IN THE ASS

## REMOVE THERMAL RELIEF ON GROUNDING VIAS?
- Some VIAS DO NOT CONNECTO TO GND FILLS
- Change the big vias to actual vias (currently "pads")

## LENTGH MATCHING NOT TO SPEC, WAY TO TIGHT TURNS, UP TO SPEC IS IMPOSSIBLE?

## DOUBLE CHECK USB-C PINOUT

## SWITCH TO BIGGER VIAS WHEN NOT NEEDED TO BE SMALL, OTHER VIAS FOR SS?

## MAKE POLIGON POUR UNDER NEATH USB C and traces around mux IN VCC LAYER CONNECTED TO GND??

- ALL DOWN STREAM USB 2 TRACES ARE SWITCHED POLARITY, MUST BE FIXED IN SW!

## KNOWN BREAKING OF BEST PRACTICES:
- High speed traces to close and under crystal
- High speed traces on internal layers (better coupling to ground like it is?)
- Ensure that high-speed differential signals are routed = 90 mils from the edge of the reference plane. (SS SIGNAL TO P3 IS TO CLOSE TO EDGE, is about 45 mil)


## TO NEXT REVISION
CHANGE TO ONLY SURFACE MOUNT USB C CONNECTOR, NOT OPTIMAL ROUTING, DONE LIKE THAT FOR EASY SOLDERING
