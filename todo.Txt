## TODO
- check height of USB-A connectors
- change stackup to signal gnd gnd signal2
- route power in ground planes

- redo length matching with proper vias

## PCB Specs:
Designed for https://www.multi-circuit-boards.eu, 4 layers: 4L-01 (1.6mm)
stackup:
copper 35 um
dielectric prepreg1080 x2, 140 um
copper 35 um
core 1200 um
copper 35 um
dielectric prepreg1080 x2, 140 um

## USB HUB SETTINGS:
- ALL DOWN STREAM USB 2 TRACES TO CONNECTORS ARE SWITCHED POLARITY, MUST BE FIXED IN SW! (NOT MCU!)
- do leght matching in pair instead of single trace matching
- use xtraces in altium?

GAP IN LEHGTHTUNING SHOULD BE 5x TRACK WIDTH, min 3x trackwidth! (youtubeguden)
använd 1 och 2 för att justera kanterna.


## KNOWN BREAKING OF BEST PRACTICES:
- High speed traces to close and under crystal
- High speed traces on internal layers (better coupling to ground like it is?)
- Ensure that high-speed differential signals are routed = 90 mils from the edge of the reference plane. (SS SIGNAL TO P3 IS TO CLOSE TO EDGE, is about 45 mil)
- Length matching width etc is to small, not up to spec

## TO NEXT REVISION
CHANGE TO ONLY SURFACE MOUNT USB C CONNECTOR, NOT OPTIMAL ROUTING, DONE LIKE THAT FOR EASY SOLDERING
