NGFF Pinout from here: https://pinoutguide.com/HD/M.2_NGFF_connector_pinout.shtml
Do we need to modify HUB flash config, is tx rx swapped on port 3 DN/DP? It is not swapped for SATA-controller. I think it is was swapped for connector.


DOUBLE CHECK SSD SWITCH SO IT WORKS AS I THINK!


Add connector pinout on backside
